# Data-Products-Week-4-Project
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

# Diamond Data set
A dataset containing the prices and other variables of almost 54,000 diamonds.
There are 10 variables including price, carat weight, cut, clairity, and color.
I used mainly price , carat, cut variables to find out that  how many diamonds are there in selected data with price, carat variables.

# Part1: Shiny Application
Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server

Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

# Part2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.
Here's what you need
5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
Your presentation pushed to github
A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below

# Your presentation must satisfy the following
It must be done in Slidify
It must be 5 pages
It must be on github
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
