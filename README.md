# Data-Products-Week-4-Project
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

# Diamond Data set
A dataset containing the prices and other variables of almost 54,000 diamonds.
There are 10 variables including price, carat weight, cut, clairity, and color.
I used mainly price , carat, cut variables to find out that  how many diamonds are there in selected data with price, carat variables.
